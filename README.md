## Hamber Stack


**NOTE: This project, while exciting, is still an early prototype. While being mostly stable it is still being iterated with feature changes and improvements fairly regularly.**

Hapijs - A Javascript fullstack and cli that uses two of the best frameworks and [Ember](http://emberjs.com/), so you can rapidly create production-ready web applications. It takes away all the hassle setting up the full backend and frontend environment, embracing convention-over-configuration all the way, so you can focus just on shipping your app. Additionally this cli also supports Docker, using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), to automatically install dependencies such as your database and will make deployment easier.

Quickstart:
* `npm install -g hamber-cli`


**Note: If you use Docker, make sure you have [Docker Compose](http://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed. On Mac or Windows also [boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io/) and for Linux see: [https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/](https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/)**
